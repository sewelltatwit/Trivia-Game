## Trivia Tastic 

**What?**
>an efficient program that is simple to manage and quick to play that allows
>a more flexible experience. A minimalistic game such as a trivia could help stimulate a player
>and make their enjoyment feel more rewarding.

**Why?**
1. Mobile trivia multiplayer games are either outdated or uninteresting. 
2. Trivia is something that many see as a productive form of entertainment.
3. Also, many of these games are either only for entertainment or restricted 
to being a ‘study tool’ allowing it to be customizable makes it so the
player can do both. 

**How**
We will have an always on server that will feed information to clients which will 
send keyword input back to the server.

**Deliverable**
By the end of the semester we expect to have a fully functioning game that
will allow users to connect between themselves and the server. There will be questions received
by a user who will submit an answer, which will then be interpreted by the server. Once the test
is complete a score will be returned, and perhaps the questions that were incorrect with the
expected answers.


**Plan**
- 11/10/18 - A working connection will be established between two (possibly more) end users that
can transmit messages.
- 11/20/18 - A game that works in a controlled setting
- 11/25/18 - We hope to have a finished “trivia server” that will handle messages sent to and from
end users and eventually record them.
- 12/1/19 - A reliable connection and bugless game

# Comments
1. Give more details on the deliverables. Think about what you are going to demo in the final presentation and compile a list of features that will be delivered. What does it mean by a fully functioning trivia game? 
2. For the plan, remove [], add the concrete date ranges. Don't use "we hope"
