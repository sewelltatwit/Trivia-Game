# Progress Updates (Oct 29 - Nov 30)

## Week 1 (Oct 29 - Nov 5)

### What did your team do last week?
* Set up repository
* Make plan

### What will you do this week?
* Begin writing skeleton code
* Create a player object class and a question object class

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
* Shouldn't be any issues or challenges yet


## Week 2 (Nov 5 - Nov 12)

### What did your team do last week?
Finished skeleton code including the outline of a player and question class, an array of questions, helper methods to set the question and answers. The question class acts as a server for the game; the person running the question class is the session host. 

### What will you do this week?
Try to send a question with a response answer from one machine to another

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
The process of sending a message from one machine to another reliably will
most likely be the most daunting challenge of the project.
The demo in class will be followed as a guideline for this problem.

# Comments
1. Break down more on the bullet points. For example Finished skeleton code and question class --> What are in the skeleton code? What question class is for?

## Week 3 (Nov 19  - Nov 26)

### What did your team do last week?
* Managed to make a connection between two computers 
* GUI that displays the question and has a button for each answer choice

### What will your team do this week? 
Try to send the question and answer between the server machine and the client machine since we weren't able to last week

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
Sending a message from one machine to another is challenging for us, but we are using our chat program as a guideline.

## Week 4 (Nov 26 - Dec 3)

### What did your team do last week?
* Have the connection between users send data back and forth
* Clean up code and finished the client side reciving method

### What will your team do this week?
This week will fully implement the GUI with the data as to create a functioning game. 

### Any blocking issues/challenges need to be addressed?
We have had issues having the information sent in through an array being read correctly.
